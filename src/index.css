  NOTE: Removed previous global element styles (body, button, a, h1, :root)
  which were overriding Tailwind utility classes and causing inconsistent
  visuals. Use Tailwind utility classes in components instead. If you need
  app-wide variables or light/dark defaults, prefer scoped classes or
  Tailwind configuration.
